# Small Library
This is a project to practice object concepts in javascript, including prototype inheritance. You can find the lesson on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

## How this works?
Each book on the page is an object which values are displayed on a card.
You can create a new book or delete an already existing.
